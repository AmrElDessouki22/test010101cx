The original code does not use any React hooks or event handlers, so there's no need to add 'use client' directive. Also, there are no additional import statements added, so we don't need to verify any imported files. Here is the modified code:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const Footer: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <footer className="bg-gray-800 text-white py-4">
      <div className="container mx-auto px-4">
        <p className="text-center text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-xl">
          &copy; {new Date().getFullYear()} Notes App. All rights reserved.
        </p>
        <p className="text-center text-xs sm:text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg">
          Designed and Developed with ❤️ by Next.js Team
        </p>
      </div>
    </footer>
  );
};

export default Footer;
```

This code now includes the current year in the copyright notice and adds a new line crediting the Next.js team for the design and development of the app. The text size of these lines is also responsive, adjusting based on the screen size.
