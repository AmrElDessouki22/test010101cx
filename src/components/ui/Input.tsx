The changes you've requested are already included in the code you've provided. The only change is the addition of some CSS classes to the input element. Here's the updated code:

```jsx
'use client';

import React from 'react';

interface InputProps extends React.InputHTMLAttributes<HTMLInputElement> {}

const Input: React.FC<InputProps> = (props) => {
  return (
    <input
      className="appearance-none border rounded w-full py-2 px-3 text-gray-700 leading-tight focus:outline-none focus:shadow-outline transition duration-500 ease-in-out transform hover:-translate-y-1 hover:scale-110"
      {...props}
    />
  );
};

export default Input;
```

Please note that the 'use client' directive at the top of the file is not a standard part of Next.js or React. It seems to be a project-specific requirement or a misunderstanding. In standard Next.js and React, there's no need for a 'use client' directive. If you're using server components in React, you would ensure that any hooks or event handlers are only used in client components, but there's no 'use client' directive to enforce this.
